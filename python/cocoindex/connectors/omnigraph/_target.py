    """Bucket reconcile actions into three phases and combine each phase's
    mutations into one commit per phase (chunked past `_MAX_ENTITIES_PER_TYPE`).

    Phase A (pre-deletes): deletes of *replaced* edges only. Must precede
    their re-insert in phase B — delete selects on `coco_key`, and a
    replaced edge keeps the same one, so insert-then-delete would remove the
    new edge too (verified against the engine: leaves zero edges).

    Phase B (upserts): node upserts, THEN edge inserts (both brand-new and
    replaced). The order within the phase matters even though the whole
    phase is one commit: statements in a combined query execute in the
    order written, so an edge insert placed ahead of its own endpoint's
    upsert fails with "not found" and forces the stub-and-retry path on
    every run — a costly recovery meant for genuine cross-component
    ordering violations, not for two writes the same component is issuing
    together. Grouping nodes first makes that self-inflicted case
    impossible; a failure can then only mean the endpoint really is owned
    by another component that hasn't run yet.

    No endpoint stubs here — a keyed `insert` in Omnigraph is a
    full-record replace, not a partial merge (verified against the engine),
    so unconditionally stubbing an edge's endpoints would silently null out
    any other nullable properties a node already has. Instead the sink
    applies an edge insert optimistically and only builds a stub, for
    *just* the specific endpoint the engine reports missing, after that
    insert fails with a "not found" error — see `_apply_entity_actions`.

    Phase C (post-deletes): edge deletes, then node deletes — of removals
    only (a replaced edge's delete is phase A, not this). Edges must be gone
    before their nodes.

    A and C cannot merge into one commit even though both are deletes: A
    must precede B and C must follow it.

    """Fold every schema-changing action for one graph into one read and at
    most two writes.

    Omnigraph's schema is applied whole-graph, not per type (verified
    against the engine: applying a single new type's fragment alone
    silently dropped every other existing type). Task 6 reconciles each
    type independently and only ever renders that one type's fragment, so
    every action funnels through here: read the current whole-graph
    source, fold this batch's fragments into it in memory, and write the
    result back. The whole batch arrives in one call — the sink's batcher
    never has more than one group in flight — so doing a full
    read-merge-write round-trip per action would be N times the CLI
    invocations for the same end state.

    `kind` doesn't select a code path. A brand-new type's action is always
    `"create"`, even when it's the *second* type ever declared on an
    already-`init`'d graph, so `client.read_schema()` returning `None` is
    the only signal for "not yet initialized" — it subsumes the old
    create-or-alter stderr-sniffing fallback entirely.

    Two exceptions to the single write:

    `"drop"` removes the type's block. Nothing else deletes a dropped
    type's nodes or edges: when a container target state disappears the
    engine emits no per-child deletes, so if this didn't drop the block,
    the type and every row in it would persist forever, untracked.

    `"replace"` (a `@key` or edge-endpoint change) cannot go through the
    ordinary merge: the engine flatly rejects an in-place key change
    ("removing property constraints ... not supported in schema migration
    v1", verified against the binary — not a soft/hard-drop distinction,
    `--allow-data-loss` doesn't help). It needs a genuine rebuild, so a
    batch containing any `"replace"` costs one extra `schema apply` that
    lands the replaced types' removal first, before the final apply
    re-adds them under their new definitions. `child_invalidation=
    "destructive"` on a `"replace"` already tells every child entity it
    must be re-declared from scratch, which is exactly what the drop half
    does at the schema level.

    Its key must be one the connector can render the way the engine does.

    inserting a key-only stub for the endpoint the engine reports missing
    (see `_build_endpoint_stub`). That stub can never satisfy a non-nullable
